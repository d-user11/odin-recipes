    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Borsh is a traditional Russian soup prepared from beets and cabbage. It is usually served with a spoon of sour

        meats.</p>

        <li>* Special Note on Beets: Although beets are the most beautiful rich fuchsia on the inside, their juices will
            stain everything hot pink, including your hands and cutting board. The best way to prep fresh beets for this
            recipe is to first peel them with a peeler, cut into thin slices, and finally, layer and cut into matchlike
            sticks.</li>
        <li>* For Vegetarians: simply substitute 3 cups of chicken broth with water, and omit chicken bouillon for a
            great vegetarian variation.</li>
