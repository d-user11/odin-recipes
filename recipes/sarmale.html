            <li>Water - the base for the sauce.</li>
            <li>Oil - used a lot in this recipe.</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry the meat in oil (20 minutes.) Add the carrots and onion and cook for 10 more minutes. Stir in the
                paprika and steak seasoning; set aside.</li>
            <li>Rinse the Jasmine rice 3x. Cover with hot tap water and allow to sit while you wilt the cabbage
                (stirring
                occasionally.)</li>
            <li>Wilt the cabbage leaves by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil. Wilt each head for a total of 10
                minutes per head, removing the outer leaves as you cook.</li>
            <li>Drain the rice reserving 1 cup of the liquid.</li>
            <li>Combine the meat stir-fry, rice, reserved water, and 1 Tbsp of salt.</li>
            <li>Cut and Trim the cabbage leaves.</li>
            <li>Fill, Roll, and Stack the cabbage rolls into an oven-safe pot. Nadia places leftover cabbage trimmings
                onto
                the bottom to prevent scorched rolls. Add bayleaves half way between stacking. Cover Rolls with any torn
                or
                leftover cabbage leaves.</li>
            <li>Stir together the water, salt, and diced tomatoes. Pour over the rolls and cover with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in a pre-heated 350Â°F for 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
