    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat
        sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù,
        béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Spaghetti sauce</b>: Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <li><b>Cheeses</b>: You’ll need cottage cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>: Eggs help bind the cheese mixture together. Plus, they lend moisture and richness.</li>
        <li><b>Seasonings</b>: Season the easy lasagna with dried parsley, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Lasagna noodles</b>: Of course, you’ll need lasagna noodles!</li>
